# MobileESPConverted

This is a Ruby implementation of MobileESP library. It has been automatically
generated from Java source code from the
[official MobileESP repository](http://code.google.com/p/mobileesp/source/browse).

MobileESP provides device type detection (tablet, mobile, etc.) based on HTTP
request headers.


## License and more info

I just converted the code to Ruby, the original author is Anthony Hand.

For licensing of MobileESP and more info see [MobileESP official site](http://mobileesp.com).
